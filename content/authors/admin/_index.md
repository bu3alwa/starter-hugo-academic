My name is Ali and I graduated from Kansas State University with a BSc. in Computer Science. In my free time, I enjoy learning about the financial market, cryptocurrency, real estate, and gaming. 

I am very passionate about cyber security and have participated in multiple ctf's and tournaments during my University time. I aspire to reach a position red-teaming/pen-testing role. I am also very into automating things, aggregating data, and monitoring. I manage a couple of personal servers and monitor them for entertainment.

I would like to continue my education one day and aquire a master's degree with a specialization in cyber security.
